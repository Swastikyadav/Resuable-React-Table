## Project Demo

Loom Screencast: https://www.loom.com/share/5c12e548a0344e21ab8fca76bea5d0b8

## Assumptions Made

- Column reordering done with drag and drop (used react-dnd package).
- Used axios instead of native fetch API for browser compatibility.
- Did not wrote tests as it was not mentioned in the assignment.
- Used custom CSS, could have used styled components or tailwindCSS to make the table a bit more reusable.

- Clone and pull the project to your local env.
- In the project directory, run the following commands.
- `yarn` - This will install all the required dependencies.
- `yarn run start` - This will start the project on http://localhost:3000
